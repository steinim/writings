# DevOpsDays is coming to Oslo!

For the first time, DevOpsDays is coming to Oslo! DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners. It brings together leaders in Software Development and IT Operations to collaborate and learn from each other. It is both a technical conference and a conference focusing on culture, processes and structure within organizations.

# Origins
The very first DevOpsDays was launched in Ghent, Belgium in 2009. [Patrick Debois](http://www.jedi.be/), after having seen [John Allspaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jallspaw) and [Paul Hammond](http://www.paulhammond.org/) give the talk [10+ Deploys a Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr](http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/10-deploys-per-day-dev-and-ops-cooperation-at-flickr) at the O’Reilly Velocity 09 conference via streamed video, decided he wanted to organize a conference about Agile for Systems Administration. He took the first three letters of development and operations, added the word "days", and called it [DevOpsDays](http://www.devopsdays.org/). The term DevOps is born, and the #DevOps Twitter hashtag has since been an enormous well of information and inspiration for developers and sysadmins alike. As of today there has been 76 DevOpsDays around the globe since the very first one in 2009. There are already 32 conferences under planning for 2016.

> ... I wanted to do a conference for getting people together and 'Agile System Administration Conference' was just too long, so I just picked the word 'DevOpsDays' as Dev and Ops working together because Agile System Administration was also too narrow on focusing on sysadmins only.
> - [Patrick Debois on the State of DevOps](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/debois-devops), InfoQ video interview from April 2012.

I have attended two DevOpsDays myself — [DevOpsDays Berlin](http://open.bekk.no/devopsdays-berlin-2015) and [DevOpsDays Roma](http://open.bekk.no/stemningsrapport-fra-devopsdays-roma-dag-1) — and they were both amazing events. I hope and believe that [DevOpsDays in Oslo](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-oslo/) will be equally great.

# DevOps in 2016
Since the origins of DevOps a lot has happened. DevOps is seen as a huge paradigm shift within IT, and within business in general. Continuous Delivery and DevOps has allowed businesses to continuously push high-quality software to customers quickly and at large scale. The quality of what is produced increases with the frequency of deliveries.

That requires that everyone — from developers to security to UX, business and operations — collaborate throughout the whole process and gather feedback continuously. Organizations have discovered that when people work together closely, everyone is pulling in the same direction and they share common goals.

The emergence of cloud has also had a tremendous effect. As applications get more distributed, virtualized and pushed into the cloud, the way we develop and operate our systems change. Many tools have emerged and the focus on automation, infrastructure as code, monitoring and measuring has become extremely important.

Today we are witnessing perhaps the most disruptive and innovative period in IT in our time. Those not transforming their IT organizations towards DevOps and Continuous Delivery risk being left behind to die. The DevOpsDays conference is important!

# DevOpsDays Oslo 2016
I am really looking forward to the [DevOpsDays conference in Oslo](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-oslo/) on September 5th and 6th 2016. At a high-level, each day will consist of a mix of presentations, ignite presentations, and open spaces. There will be an evening party for all participants scheduled for the evening of September 5th. A great opportunity for networking, mingling and having a good time.

It is, as always with DevOpsDays, a community event. The organizers are all volunteers working for different companies in Norway, and the conference is totally non profit. In order for us to be able to host the conference we are totally dependent on sponsors. I therefore urge you to convince whoever you need to convince to [sponsor the event](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-oslo/sponsor/). We also need a lot of interesting speakers, so go ahead and [submit a proposal](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-oslo/propose/), and of course we want all of you to attend the conference. Register [here](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-oslo/registration/).

**See you in Oslo this fall!**
